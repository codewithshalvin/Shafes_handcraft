# Recent Orders Activity Fix

## Problem
The "Recent Orders Activity" section in the Admin Reports page was showing "No recent orders" even though there are 20 orders in the database.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Missing `recentOrders` in API Response
The `/api/admin/reports` endpoint was not fetching or returning `recentOrders` data. It only included:
- `overview` stats
- `currentPeriod` (weekly/monthly)
- `topProducts`
- `salesTrend`
- `expensesByCategory`

But it was missing `recentOrders` which the frontend expects.

### 2. Incorrect Field Name in Queries
All aggregation queries were using `status` field, but the Order schema actually uses `orderStatus`.

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes (server.js)

#### Fix 1: Added `recentOrders` to orderStats object (Line 218)
```javascript
let orderStats = {
  totalSales: 0,
  totalOrders: 0,
  monthlySales: 0,
  monthlyOrders: 0,
  weeklySales: 0,
  weeklyOrders: 0,
  topProducts: [],
  salesTrend: [],
  recentOrders: []  // ‚úÖ ADDED
};
```

#### Fix 2: Fetch recent orders (Lines 290-302)
```javascript
// Get recent orders (last 10)
orderStats.recentOrders = await Order.find({})
  .select('orderNumber orderId totalAmount orderStatus paymentStatus shippingAddress createdAt user')
  .populate('user', 'name email')
  .sort({ createdAt: -1 })
  .limit(10)
  .lean()
  .catch((err) => {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to fetch recent orders:', err.message);
    return [];
  });

console.log('üì¶ Recent orders fetched:', orderStats.recentOrders.length);
```

#### Fix 3: Include recentOrders in response (Line 363)
```javascript
const responseData = {
  success: true,
  data: {
    overview: { ... },
    currentPeriod: { ... },
    recentOrders: orderStats.recentOrders,  // ‚úÖ ADDED
    topProducts: orderStats.topProducts,
    salesTrend: orderStats.salesTrend,
    expensesByCategory
  }
};
```

#### Fix 4: Changed all `status` to `orderStatus` in aggregations
- Line 228: Total sales query
- Line 232: Monthly sales query
- Line 239: Weekly sales query
- Line 255: Top products query
- Line 274: Sales trend query

Before:
```javascript
{ $match: { status: { $ne: 'cancelled' } } }
```

After:
```javascript
{ $match: { orderStatus: { $ne: 'cancelled' } } }
```

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server
The code changes have been saved but the server needs to restart to pick them up.

**Option A: Kill and restart manually**
```powershell
# Stop the running node process
Stop-Process -Name "node" -Force

# Start the server again
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\mwtproject (3)current\mwtproject (3)fe\mwtproject\mwtc\mwtc12\backend
node server.js
```

**Option B: If using nodemon (auto-restart)**
Just save the server.js file again, and nodemon will restart automatically.

### Step 2: Refresh the Admin Reports Page
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/admin/reports
2. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. The "Recent Orders Activity" table should now show the 10 most recent orders

## Expected Result

After restarting the backend and refreshing the page, you should see:

### Recent Orders Activity Table
```
ORDER ID          | CUSTOMER       | AMOUNT    | STATUS     | PAYMENT | DATE
ORDER_175950...   | John Doe       | ‚Çπ720.00   | delivered  | paid    | Oct 22, 2025
ORDER_175951...   | Jane Smith     | ‚Çπ300.00   | delivered  | paid    | Oct 22, 2025
...
```

## Verification

### Test the API directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/reports
```

Look for the `recentOrders` array in the response. It should contain up to 10 order objects with:
- `orderId`
- `orderStatus`
- `paymentStatus`
- `totalAmount`
- `shippingAddress` (with customer name)
- `createdAt`
- `user` (populated with name and email)

### Database Verification
We verified that there are **20 orders** in the database:
```
‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB
üì¶ Total orders in database: 20

üìã Sample orders:
  - ORDER_1759507797937_niensy9fm: delivered / paid - ‚Çπ720
  - ORDER_1759510436854_y8suf7vd5: delivered / paid - ‚Çπ300
  - ORDER_1759743472573_fnvxot90v: confirmed / pending - ‚Çπ1380
```

## Summary of Files Changed

1. **backend/server.js** - Lines 218, 228, 232, 239, 255, 274, 290-302, 363
   - Added recentOrders to orderStats
   - Fixed field name from `status` to `orderStatus`
   - Fetched recent orders from database
   - Included recentOrders in API response

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists after restart:

1. **Check server console** for errors or the log message:
   ```
   üì¶ Recent orders fetched: 10
   ```

2. **Check browser console** for API response
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Find the request to `/api/admin/reports`
   - Check if `recentOrders` array is present in response

3. **Verify server is using updated code**
   - Check the server startup time matches your restart time
   - Look for the log messages we added

## Additional Notes

- The fix also improves data accuracy by using the correct `orderStatus` field throughout all statistics calculations
- Orders with status "cancelled" are now properly excluded from sales calculations
- The recentOrders query uses `.lean()` for better performance
- Error handling is included to prevent the entire reports endpoint from failing if orders fetch fails
